Guido.js
========

Guido.js provides musical tools for Javascript. 

Write music. Morph it. Display it, and play it!

## What is it?

Guido.js provides javascript tools to encode, manipulate, display and play music.

The core of Guido.js is the Guido music notation format, which looks like this: 

    [ \clef<"treble"> \key<"D"> \meter<"4/4">
     a1*1/2 b a/4. g/8 f#/4 g a/2 b a/4. g/8 f#/4 g
     a/2 a b c#2/4 d c#/2 b1 a/1 ]

The snippet above might render to something like this:

## Why is it called 'Guido'?

Guido is named for Guido d'Arezzo, the person widely considered to be the inventor of common western musical notation. See [this Wikipedia Article on Guido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_of_Arezzo) for more information.

We like other people named Guido too. Like this one:
